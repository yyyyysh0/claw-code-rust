## 💡 What is This

This project extracts the core runtime ideas from [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and reorganizes them into a set of reusable Rust crates. It's not a line-by-line TypeScript translation — it's a clean-room redesign of the capabilities an agent truly depends on:

- **Message Loop** — driving multi-turn conversations
- **Tool Execution** — orchestrating tool calls with schema validation
- **Permission Control** — authorization before file/shell/network access
- **Long-running Tasks** — background execution with lifecycle management
- **Context Compaction** — keeping long sessions stable under token budgets
- **Model Providers** — unified interface for streaming LLM backends
- **MCP Integration** — extending capabilities via Model Context Protocol

Think of it as an **agent runtime skeleton**:

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Top** | A thin CLI that assembles all crates |
| **Middle** | Core runtime: message loop, tool orchestration, permissions, tasks, model abstraction |
| **Bottom** | Concrete implementations: built-in tools, MCP client, context management |

> If the boundaries are clean enough, this can serve not only Claude-style coding agents, but any agent system that needs a solid runtime foundation.

## 🤔 Why Rebuild in Rust

Claude Code has excellent engineering quality, but it's a **complete product**, not a reusable runtime library. UI, runtime, tool systems, and state management are deeply intertwined. Reading the source teaches a lot, but extracting parts for reuse is nontrivial.

This project aims to:

- **Decompose** tightly coupled logic into single-responsibility crates
- **Replace** runtime constraints with trait and enum boundaries
- **Transform** "only works inside this project" implementations into **reusable agent components**

## 🎯 Design Goals

1. **Runtime first, product later.** Prioritize solid foundations for Agent loop, Tool, Task, and Permission.
2. **Each crate should be self-explanatory.** Names reveal responsibility, interfaces reveal boundaries.
3. **Make replacement natural.** Tools, model providers, permission policies, and compaction strategies should all be swappable.
4. **Learn from Claude Code's experience** without replicating its UI or internal features.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Crate Map

| Crate | Purpose | Derived From (Claude Code) |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| `agent-core` | Message model, state container, main loop, session | `query.ts`, `QueryEngine.ts`, `state/store.ts` |
| `agent-tools` | Tool trait, registry, execution orchestration | `Tool.ts`, `tools.ts`, tool service layer |
| `agent-tasks` | Long task lifecycle and notification mechanism | `Task.ts`, `tasks.ts` |
| `agent-permissions` | Tool call authorization and rule matching | `types/permissions.ts`, `utils/permissions/` |
| `agent-provider` | Unified model interface, streaming, retry | `services/api/` |
| `agent-compact` | Context trimming and token budget control | `services/compact/`, `query/tokenBudget.ts` |
| `agent-mcp` | MCP client, connection, discovery, reconnect | `services/mcp/` |
| `tools-builtin` | Built-in tool implementations | `tools/` |
| `claude-cli` | Executable entry point, assembles all crates | CLI layer |

## 🔍 Crate Overview

<details>
<summary><b>agent-core</b> — The foundation</summary>

Manages how a conversation turn starts, continues, and stops. Defines the unified message model, main loop, and session state. This is the bedrock of the entire system.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-tools</b> — Tool definition & dispatch</summary>

Defines "what a tool looks like" and "how tools are scheduled." The Rust version avoids stuffing all context into one giant object — instead, tools only receive the parts they actually need.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-tasks</b> — Background task runtime</summary>

Separating tool calls from runtime tasks is critical for supporting long commands, background agents, and completion notifications fed back into the conversation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-permissions</b> — Authorization layer</summary>

Controls what the agent can do, when it must ask the user, and when to refuse outright. Essential whenever agents read files, write files, or execute commands.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-provider</b> — Model abstraction</summary>

Shields the system from differences between model backends. Unifies streaming output, retry logic, and error recovery.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-compact</b> — Context management</summary>

Ensures long session stability. Not just "summarization" — applies different compression levels and budget controls based on context to prevent unbounded growth.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>agent-mcp</b> — MCP integration</summary>

Connects to external MCP services, bringing remote tools, resources, and prompts into the unified capability surface.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>tools-builtin</b> — Built-in tools</summary>

Implements the most commonly used tools, prioritizing file operations, shell commands, search, and editing — the basic operations any agent needs.
</details>

## ⚖️ Rust vs TypeScript

| TypeScript (Claude Code) | Rust Approach |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Extensive runtime checks | Push checks into the type system |
| Context objects tend to grow unbounded | Smaller context / trait boundaries |
| Scattered callbacks and events | Unified, continuous event streams |
| Runtime feature flags | Compile-time feature gating where possible |
| UI and runtime tightly coupled | Runtime as an independent layer |

> This isn't about Rust being "better" — it's about Rust being well-suited for **locking down runtime boundaries**. For a long-evolving agent system, such constraints are typically valuable.

## 🗺 Roadmap

<div align="center">
<img src="./docs/assets/roadmap.svg" alt="Roadmap" width="100%" />
</div>

### Phase 1: Get It Running

- Set up `agent-core`, `agent-tools`, `agent-provider`, `agent-permissions`
- Implement basic `Bash`, `FileRead`, `FileWrite` tools
- Deliver a minimal runnable CLI

> **Goal:** A basic version that can chat, call tools, execute commands, and read/write files.

### Phase 2: Make Sessions Stable

- Add `agent-tasks` for background tasks and notifications
- Add `agent-compact` for long sessions and large result handling
- Expand `tools-builtin` with editing, search, and sub-agent capabilities

> **Goal:** Sessions that can last longer without becoming fragile due to oversized outputs or long-running tasks.

### Phase 3: Open the Boundaries

- Integrate `agent-mcp`
- Add plugin/skill loading capabilities
- Support SDK / headless usage for embedded scenarios

> **Goal:** Not just a CLI, but a complete agent runtime that can be integrated into other systems.
